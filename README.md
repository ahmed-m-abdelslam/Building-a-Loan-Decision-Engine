# Explanation of the Approach, Machine Learning Algorithm, and Assumptions

## 1. Problem Context and Objective

 The task involves building a loan approval system that predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting. The goal is to make decisions that maximize the net profit, balancing income from approved loans and losses from defaults. This problem presents a significant challenge due to the class imbalance, where the minority class (defaults) has a much smaller representation than the majority class (non-defaults).

## 2. Data Preprocessing

#### To ensure the model performs well, the following preprocessing steps were undertaken:
 - Feature Scaling: Standardized the numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model's predictions.
 - Addressing Class Imbalance: Applied class_weight='balanced' in the Logistic Regression model to adjust the contribution of each class to the loss function, mitigating the effects of imbalance.

## 3. Machine Learning Algorithm

#### The final model selected was Logistic Regression, with the following considerations:

#### Why Logistic Regression?

- Logistic Regression provides interpretable results in terms of probabilities, which is critical for threshold-based decision-making.
- It performs well when the relationship between features and the target variable is approximately linear.
- With the inclusion of class_weight='balanced', Logistic Regression compensates for the imbalanced dataset by assigning higher weights to the minority class.

#### Hyperparameter Selection:

- random_state=42 ensures reproducibility of results.
- max_iter=500 ensures convergence of the optimization process, especially given the complexity of imbalanced data.
- class_weight='balanced' automatically adjusts weights inversely proportional to class frequencies, improving recall for the minority class.

#### Evaluation Metrics:

- Precision (0.15): Indicates a relatively low proportion of true positives among predicted positives. This is a trade-off for prioritizing recall.
- Recall (0.94): Highlights the model's strong ability to identify defaults, which is critical for this task.
- F1 Score (0.25): Combines precision and recall into a single metric, reflecting the trade-off between the two.
- ROC-AUC (0.75): Demonstrates the model's ability to discriminate between classes.


## 4. Model Performance and Optimization

The high recall (0.92) means the model successfully identifies most loan defaults, minimizing the financial loss associated with undetected defaults. This is achieved by using a balanced weight scheme, which prioritizes the minority class. However, the relatively low precision (0.15) indicates that the model approves some non-defaulting loans as defaults, a reasonable trade-off for this specific application.

Additionally, the model's predictions were threshold-adjusted to improve net profit by maximizing recall while controlling for unnecessary rejections.

## 5. Assumptions

#### Economic Assumptions:

- The flat fee for approved loans (30 OMR) and the variable loss per default (ranging between 100 OMR and 1000 OMR) are accurate representations of the institution's financial model.
- The range of losses (100â€“1000 OMR) reflects realistic variations in loan amounts, default severity, or associated costs, and it is assumed these values remain consistent over time.

#### Data Assumptions:

- The training data is representative of future loan applicants in terms of feature distributions and default patterns.
- All the provided features are relevant and sufficient to predict loan defaults effectively.
- There are no hidden biases or errors in the data collection process that could impact model predictions.

#### Evaluation Assumptions:

- Metrics like recall are prioritized because failing to identify a default (false negative) incurs higher financial risk than mistakenly rejecting a non-defaulting applicant (false positive).
- The trade-off between income and losses is accurately captured by the cost-benefit structure provided in the task, and the goal is to optimize net profit, not just classification accuracy.

## 6. Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model with class_weight='balanced' was selected due to its ability to handle imbalanced data effectively. It provided the best performance in terms of recall, ensuring most defaults were correctly identified, which aligns with the task's objective to minimize losses while maximizing net profit. While precision and F1 scores were modest, these are acceptable given the primary focus on high recall.

Further optimization could involve fine-tuning thresholds, exploring ensemble methods, or introducing additional features to improve overall performance.
